# Laravel + Bref

This codebase is built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x) + the [Bref library](https://bref.sh/) to run inside a custom PHP runtime for AWS Lambda.

## Local Environment

We are using the Laravel Sail Docker environment for local development. This is a series of Docker containers
orchestrated with Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml) with the added benefit of a universal `sail` command provided by a
custom bash script. This command makes calling services across the dev environment easier by abstracting away a lot of
the more verbose Docker Compose commands. The `sail` script in the project root is a modified version of the `sail` bash
script located at
`/vendor/bin/sail`, which falls back to executing that original script. Any further customizations to Sail commands
should be made in this file. More information about Laravel Sail and available commands is available [here]
(https://laravel.
com/docs/8.x/sail).

### Setup:
1. First install dependencies using Composer:
    1. If you have Composer installed globally you can run `composer install --ignore-platform-reqs` from the project root
    2. OR you can run the following command to use a Composer docker container for a one-time installation:
   ```shell
   docker run --rm \
   -v $(pwd):/opt \
   -w /opt \
   laravelsail/php80-composer:latest \
   composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
   ```
   Note: If you cannot successfully copy and past the code above then you can copy it from the Sail [docs](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail#installing-composer-dependencies-for-existing-projects).
1. Run `./sail composer run local` to copy .env file, generate a Laravel app key, and generate some IDE helper files.
1. Run `./sail up -d` to bring up the docker environment in the background
1. Run `./sail artisan migrate`
1. Run ` ./sail artisan migrate:dynamo-cache` to create the Laravel cache table in the local DynamoDB container.
1. Access the local environment at `http://localhost:80`
1. Additional docker commands via Sail:
    - `./sail stop` Stop the docker containers in the local environment.
    - `./sail down` Stop and destroy the containers in the local environment.
    - `./sail down -v` Adding the `-v` flag will remove all volumes as well (permanently remove local storage for
      containers like MySQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB).

### Sail Commands:
You can run many CLI services on the docker environment by simply prefixing with `./sail`
For example to run `composer install` in the docker environment simply run `./sail composer install`. The following
is a list of CLI commands that can be appended to `./sail`:
- `mongo`
- `docker-compose`
- `php`
- `composer`
- `artisan`
- `test`
- `tinker`
- `npm`
- `mysql`
- `shell`
- `root-shell`
- `share`

More information and additional commands are available in the [Laravel Sail documentaion](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail)

### Debugging:

####Xdebug
Xdebug is enabled by default. To turn off Xdebug simply set `XDEBUG=false` in your .env file and re-build the docker
container: `./sail up --build -d`.
